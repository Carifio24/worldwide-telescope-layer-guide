“Layers” are individual graphical elements in [AAS WorldWide Telescope][wwt]
that can be added or manipulated to build up complex scenes in the WWT
rendering engine. If you’re loading an individual image or tabular data set
into WWT, you’re creating a layer — but layers are also the building blocks
for the construction of professional-grade planetarium shows or web-based
explanatory tours. This guide describes how to create various layers in WWT
and demonstrates some of the more sophisticated things you can do with them.

If you just want to get your scientific imagery or tabular data into WWT to
view them, the shortest path forward is to use [pywwt] inside [JupyterLab].
Meanwhile, if you need to understand how to process your data so that they
can be added as WWT layers, consult the [Data Guide].
